Changes with Tequila server 1.0

  1) Resources.

     Resources are predefined application clients. Everything this client needs
     must be in the definition of the resource. Resources files are placed in the
     <tequila_dir>/Resources. The name of the file is the name of the resource.
     Resources must present a valid SSL certificate when they request user
     attributes. This certificate must be signed by the local organization CA.

     Apart from the client attributes, there is 3 specific attributes to describe
     the resource :

	- contact : The email address of the person responsible for this resource.
	- checkresource : If value is anything else than 'n', Tequila checks the
	  cn of the certificate to match the resource name itself.
	- allowedhosts : The list of hosts that are allowed host the resource.
	  If specified, the cn of the resource certificate must match one of these
	  hostnames. Use only if you have checkresource to 'n'.

  2) Attribute policy.

     The SensitiveAttributes from Tequila-1.0 has vanished. It is replaced with a
     much more powerful tool called policies.  At the server level, each attribute
     known to Tequila has a policy associated. This policy has one of the following
     value : Always, Confirm and Never. 'Always' attributes are given to applications
     without notice, 'Confirm' attributes are delivered only with user agreement,
    'Never' attributes are not delivered to client applications.

     Attribute policies are associated with resources. Each attribute has (can have)
     a different policy for each resource. The default server policy is user for
     anonymous clients (i.e. not associated with a resource).

     More than that, all users known to the Tequila server can manage their own
     private attribute policy. There is a special tool called Tape (Tequila
     Attribute Policy Editor) for this purpose.

  3) Plugin support (limited).

     A limited plugin support has been added. They must be Perl modules. They are can
     be used to extend the set of command understood by Tequila. The AuthDigest extension
     is written as a plugin ans can be used as an example.

  3) Portal support.

     Resources with the attribute 'portal' set can impersonate users and login to other
     Tequila applications, and to 'digest' protected web resources. see 'portallogin',
     'gendigestresponse', 'gendigestchallenge' and 'checkdigestresponse' commands. Digest
     support is implemented as a plugin.
