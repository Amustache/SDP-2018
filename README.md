### App requirements

You will build an Android application of your team’s own choosing, written exclusively in Java. The application functionality is up to you to choose, but the design and implementation must fulfill  _all_  of the following requirements:

-   Split app model: Must use cloud-based services (e.g., Google maps, Firebase). 
-   Phone sensors: A typical smartphone provides GPS, camera, mic, etc. Your app must make sophisticated use of at least one of these sensors.
-   User support: The app must support the concept of users, and provide means of authenticating users. (Google, Facebook, EPFL’s Tequila OAuth2...)
- Database access: make use of Android's wrapper around SQLite for local database access.
-   Automated test suite: Your app must have from day one a test suite that can be executed by running a single command on the command line. You must maintain a minimum level of 80% code coverage.

### Useful commands to access the code coverage

- Execute  `./gradlew createDebugCoverageReport`
- Open `app/build/reports/coverage/debug/index.html`
